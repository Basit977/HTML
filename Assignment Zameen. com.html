    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Zameen.com was founded in 2006 by two Pakistani entrepreneur brothers, Zeeshan and Imran Ali Khan.[5][6] The brothers had been running a B2B classifieds portal in the United Kingdom, but decided to return and seek opportunities in Pakistan.[6] They began operations in an apartment in Lahore, trying to convince property agents to go online, with the fact that most of the agents did not even know how to use computers or access the web.[6] For the first few years, almost half the traffic to the website came from outside Pakistan from expatriate Pakistanis interested in the property market.[6]

        In February 2013, Zameen.com rolled out the Urdu version of its website.[7] In March 2013, the company launched a mobile version of the website.[8] In 2015, the company introduced 'Search Trends' tool allows users to explore real estate trends prevalent in the Pakistani marketplace based on the searches launched for different projects as divided into cities, localities, and sub-localities. The information is updated each month; rendered in a graphical format.[9] Furthermore, the product allows users to obtain a holistic picture of the most popular with buyers and renters at any given point over the last 12-month period.[10]
        
        In February 2016, Zameen.com launched the Pakistan Real Estate Price Index, which was created in collaboration with Lahore University of Management Sciences.[11]
        
        In November 2019, Zameen.com launched Plot Finder, a tool that allows users to access detailed, geo-coded maps of 2,500 housing projects across 38 cities in Pakistan.[12][13]
        
        In January 2020, the company introduced a new tool titled 'Property Bank'. According to the company's Country Head, the feature will "cater to tens of thousands of seller leads that go to waste due to market inefficiencies."[14] Additionally, it will catalogue more than 25,000 properties presently listed on the company website that remain without any agency representation</p>
    <h2>Emerging Markets property Group</h2>
    <p>The two brothers also co-founded the Dubai-based Emerging Markets Property Group in 2015 and Zameen.com was brought under its umbrella. EMPG saw significant investment and expansion in the years since it was founded with the group currently owning and operating Zameen.com in Pakistan, Bayut in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Jordan; Bproperty.com in Bangladesh; Mubawab in Morocco and Tunisia; and Kaidee in Thailand.[16][17]

        In April 2020, EMPG and the Netherlands-based OLX Group announced a merger of their operations in Pakistan, Egypt, Lebanon, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman, together with the OLX-owned Dubai-based classifieds website, Dubizzle.[18][19] As a result of the transaction, EMPG's valuation crossed $1 billion, making it a unicorn company;[20][21] while OLX Group became EMPG's largest single shareholder with a 39% stake.[22]</p>
    <h3>Business Model</h3>
    <p>Initially, Zameen.com allowed free property listings on its website, but shifted to the paid advertisements model in 2010.[23] In 2014, the company launched a monthly real estate print publication.[24] Today, Zameen.com offers exclusive sales and marketing services to real estate developers to generate revenue.</p>
    <h4>Logo</h4>
    <p>Zameen.com launched in 2006, bearing the "Pakistan Property Portal" tagline as part of its official logo. This logo inscription underwent a change to the more elaborate "Pakistan's No. 1 Property Website" in 2011. More recently, in 2018, it was further modified to read the Urdu transliteration of the brand's popular TVC slogan: "Har Pata, Humain Pata Hai" (Lit: We Know Every Address).[</p>
    <h5>Tv Compaigns</h5>
    <p>By September 2018, Zameen.com had successfully launched four TV campaigns promoting its website and brand operations. The first of these initiatives saw the company adopt the "Har Pata, Humain Pata Hai" slogan, which has since become part of its logo as well.[25]
 In 2017, actor Fawad Khan starred in a TV campaign titled "Humain Pata Hai Aap Ke Dil Ki Baat", coming on board as the company's official brand ambassador.[26][27] The company's 2018 campaign, popularized with its "We can help you find a house, but only you can make it a home" TVC tagline, again featured Fawad Khan.[28</p>
